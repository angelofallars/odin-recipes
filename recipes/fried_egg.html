        <h2>Crispy, Golden Goodness</h2>

        <p>Let's face it. Although they don't always look aesthetically perfect,
        we all know that crispy, browned eggs are the real deal.</p>

        <p>In this recipe, we'll be cooking sunny-side up eggs in <strong>very
            hot</strong> butter to quickly fry eggs with a good crunch.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2-4 fresh eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp. butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat
                until very hot.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs and add them to the pan right away. With a cooking spoon,
                continuously pour oil on top of the egg whites to cook the top well.</li>
            <li>Cook in medium-high heat until the bottom part of the whites are
                brown and crispy. Season with salt and pepper and
                serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

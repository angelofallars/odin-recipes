        <h2>More Than The Sum of its Parts</h2>
        <p>Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian dish that's easy to make yet
        delicious and delightful. It is ready in just <strong>20
        minutes</strong>. Personally, it is one of my most favorite dishes!</p>

        <p>Aglio e Olio means olive oil and garlic in Italian. It originated
        from Naples. At its core, it only really requires <strong>four</strong>
        ingredients, pasta, olive oil, garlic, and chili flakes. Though, of
        course,
        you can add more ingredients if you like, like parsley and parmesan.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti, linguini or penne pasta</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic <em>(sliced in thin strips)</em></li>
            <li>Red chili flakes</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Optional Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Olives</li>
            <li>Parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling water and salt for 9 minutes or
                according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over the
                <strong>lowest</strong> heat, add the garlic slices
                immediately and stir well. 
            <li>After two minutes, add the chili flakes, parsley, and olives. 
                Turn off the heat as soon as the garlic turns golden. Season
                with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Drain the cooked pasta, storing some pasta water in a cup.
                Immediately add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss. Add
                some pasta water <em>(about 1/2 cup)</em> to enhance the texture.</li>
            <li>Season the pasta with salt and pepper and top it with parmesan
                cheese and lemon juice.</li>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian dish that's easy to make yet
        delicious and delightful. It is one of my most favorite dishes and I
        just can't get enough of it!</p>

        <p>In this recipe, we'll make use of spaghetti (but you can use
        another pasta shape!), extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and pepper flakes.
